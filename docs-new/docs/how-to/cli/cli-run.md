# Run OLIVE workflows

## :material-clock-fast: Quickstart

First, you'll define an OLIVE workflow that executes the following sequence of passes in a YAML file called `my-olive-workflow.yaml`

```yaml
# my-olive-workflow.yaml
```

Next, run the workflow using:

```bash
olive run --config my-olive-workflow.yaml
```
