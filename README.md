## AI Model Optimization Toolkit for the ONNX Runtime
</div>

Given a model and targeted hardware, Olive (abbreviation of **O**nnx **LIVE**) composes the best suitable optimization techniques to output the most efficient ONNX model(s) for inferencing on the cloud or edge, while taking a set of constraints such as accuracy and latency into consideration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✨ Quickstart
If you prefer using the command line directly instead of Jupyter notebooks, we've outlined the quickstart commands here.

#### 1. Install Olive CLI
We recommend installing Olive in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

```
pip install olive-ai[auto-opt]
pip install transformers onnxruntime-genai
```
> [!NOTE]
> Olive has optional dependencies that can be installed to enable additional features. Please refer to [Olive package config](./olive/olive_config.json) for the list of extras and their dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
> For Windows users: to avoid HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING
>
> Olive depends on huggingface_hub library if you download models from there. On Windows you will get a warning like
>
> ```
> UserWarning: `huggingface_hub` cache-system uses symlinks by default to efficiently store duplicated files but your machine does not support them in C:\Users\name\.cache\huggingface\hub\model-name.
> Caching files will still work but in a degraded version that might require more space on your disk. This warning can be disabled by setting the `HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING` environment variable. For more details, see https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/how-to-cache#limitations.
> ```
>
> You can fix this warning using one of the 4 options below. Note that option 1, 2 and 3 saves diskspace, while option 4 only supresses the warning
>
> 1. Enable Developer Mode on Windows (one-time setup) documented in the [Microsoft Developer Tools Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-settings/developer-mode).
> 2. Run Python as administrator when using Olive with the huggingface_hub library.
> 3. Reconfigure where the cache is stored. This restriction is not limited to storing the cache in the default location only.
> 4. Keep using HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING=1 to suppress the warning and accept the extra disk usage.
>
> Regarding the options, you should decide what is possible in your environment (e.g. company policy) and what fits best for you.
>
> The limitation of the huggingface_hub library is also documentd in the [Hub Client Library Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/manage-cache#limitations).

#### 2. Automatic Optimizer

In this quickstart you'll be optimizing [Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct), which has many model files in the Hugging Face repo for different precisions that are not required by Olive.

Run the automatic optimization:

```bash
olive optimize \
    --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
    --precision int4 \
    --output_path models/qwen
```

>[!TIP]
><details>
><summary>PowerShell Users</summary>
>Line continuation between Bash and PowerShell are not interchangable. If you are using PowerShell, then you can copy-and-paste the following command that uses compatible line continuation.
>
>```powershell
>olive optimize `
>    --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct `
>    --output_path models/qwen `
>    --precision int4
>```
</details>
<br>

The automatic optimizer will:

1. Acquire the model from the the Hugging Face model repo.
1. Quantize the model to `int4` using GPTQ.
1. Capture the ONNX Graph and store the weights in an ONNX data file.
1. Optimize the ONNX Graph.

Olive can automatically optimize popular model *architectures* like Llama, Phi, Qwen, Gemma, etc out-of-the-box - [see detailed list here](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/exporters/onnx/overview). Also, you can optimize other model architectures by providing details on the input/outputs of the model (`io_config`).


#### 3. Inference on the ONNX Runtime

The ONNX Runtime (ORT) is a fast and light-weight cross-platform inference engine with bindings for popular programming language such as Python, C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, etc. ORT enables you to infuse AI models into your applications so that inference is handled on-device.
