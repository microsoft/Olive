# OLive - ONNX Go Live

OLive, meaning ONNX Go Live, is a sequence of docker images that automates the process of ONNX model shipping. It integrates model conversion, correctness test, and performance tuning into a single pipeline, while each component is a standalone docker image and can be scaled out. 

There are three ways to use the pipeline:

1. [Use Pipeline With Kubeflow](/pipelines): Portable and rapid solution with Kubeflow on Kubernetes to deploy easily manageable end-to-end workflow.

2. [Use With Local Web App](/web): A web application with visualization to use pipeline on your local machine. 

3. [Use With Jupyter Notebook](/notebook): Quickstart of the pipeline with tutorial using Jupyter Notebook. 

4. [Use With Command Line Tool](/windows): Run the pipeline with command line using Python. 


The backend of OLive mainly contains two docker images, ONNX converter and performance tuning image. 
1. [ONNX Converter Image](/components/onnx-converter): Converts models from different frameworks to ONNX, generates random inputs, and verifies the correctness of the converted model. The current supported frameworks are Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, CNTK, and CoreML. 

2. [Performance Tuning Image](/components/perf-test): Tunes different execution providers and environment variable options for the converted ONNX model with ONNX Runtime. Selects and outputs the option combinations with the best performance.
