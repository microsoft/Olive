# Packaging Olive artifacts

## What is Olive Packaging
Olive will output multiple candidate models based on metrics priorities. It also can package output artifacts when the user requires. Olive packaging can be used in different scenarios. There are 4 packaging types: `Zipfile`, `AzureMLModels`, `AzureMLData` and `AzureMLDeployment`.

### Zipfile
Zipfile packaging will generate a ZIP file which includes 3 folders: `CandidateModels`, `SampleCode` and `ONNXRuntimePackages`, and a `models_rank.json` file in the `output_dir` folder (from Engine Configuration):
* `CandidateModels`: top ranked output model set
    * Model file
    * Olive Pass run history configurations for candidate model
    * Inference settings (`onnx` model only)
* `SampleCode`: code sample for ONNX model
    * C++
    * C#
    * Python
* `ONNXRuntimePackages`: ONNXRuntime package files with the same version that were used by Olive Engine in this workflow run.
* `models_rank.json`: A JSON file containing a list that ranks all output models based on specific metrics across all accelerators.

#### CandidateModels
`CandidateModels` includes k folders where k is the number of ranked output models, with name `BestCandidateModel_1`, `BestCandidateModel_2`, ... and `BestCandidateModel_k`. The order is ranked by metrics priorities, starting from 1. e.g., if you have 3 metrics `metric_1`, `metric_2` and `metric_3` with priority `1`, `2` and `3`. The output models will be sorted firstly by `metric_1`. If the value of `metric_1` of 2 output models are same, they will be sorted by `metric_2`, and followed by next lower priority metric.

Each `BestCandidateModel` folder will include model file/folder. The folder also includes a json file which includes the Olive Pass run history configurations since input model, a json file with performance metrics and a json file for inference settings for the candidate model if the candidate model is an ONNX model.

#### SampleCode
Olive will only provide sample codes for ONNX model. Sample code supports 3 different programming languages: `C++`, `C#` and `Python`. And a code snippet introducing how to use Olive output artifacts to inference candidate model with recommended inference configurations.

#### Models rank JSON file
A file that contains a JSON list for ranked model info across all accelerators, e.g.:
```
[
    {
        "rank": 1,
        "model_config": {
            "type": "ONNXModel",
            "config": {
                "model_path": "path/model.onnx",
                "inference_settings": {
                    "execution_provider": [
                        "CPUExecutionProvider"
                    ],
                    "provider_options": [
                        {}
                    ],
                    "io_bind": false,
                    "session_options": {
                        "execution_mode": 1,
                        "graph_optimization_level": 99,
                        "inter_op_num_threads": 1,
                        "intra_op_num_threads": 14
                    }
                },
                "use_ort_extensions": false,
                "model_attributes": {<model_attributes>}
            }
        },
        "metrics": {
            "accuracy-accuracy": {
                "value": 0.8602941176470589,
                "priority": 1,
                "higher_is_better": true
            },
            "latency-avg": {
                "value": 36.2313,
                "priority": 2,
                "higher_is_better": false
            },
        }
    },
    {"rank": 2, "model_config": <model_config>, "metrics": <metrics>},
    {"rank": 3, "model_config": <model_config>, "metrics": <metrics>}
]
```

### AzureMLModels
AzureMLModels packaging will register the output models to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. The asset name will be set as `<packaging_config_name>_<accelerator_spec>_<model_rank>`. The order is ranked by metrics priorities, starting from 1. For instance, if the output model is ONNX model and the packaging config is:

```
{
    "type": "AzureMLModels",
    "name": "olive_output_model",
    "config": {
        "version": "1",
        "description": "description"
    }
}
```

and for CPU, the best execution provider is CPUExecutionProvider, so the first ranked model name registered on AML will be `olive_output_model_cpu-cpu_1`.

Olive will also upload model configuration file, inference config file, metrics file and model info file to the Azure ML.

### AzureMLData
AzureMLData packaging will upload the output models to your Azure Machine Learning workspace as Data assets. The asset name will be set as `<packaging_config_name>_<accelerator_spec>_<model_rank>`. The order is ranked by metrics priorities, starting from 1. For instance, if the output model is ONNX model and the packaging config is:

```
{
    "type": "AzureMLData",
    "name": "olive_output_model",
    "config": {
        "version": "1",
        "description": "description"
    }
}
```

and for CPU, the best execution provider is CPUExecutionProvider, so the first ranked model Data name on AML will be `olive_output_model_cpu-cpu_1`.

Olive will also upload model configuration file, inference config file, metrics file and model info file to the Azure ML.

### AzureMLDeployment
AzureMLDeployment packaging will [package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-package-models?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=sdk) ranked No. 1 model across all output models to Azure ML workspace, and create an endpoint for it if the endpoint doesn't exist, then deploy the output model to this endpoint.

## How to package Olive artifacts
