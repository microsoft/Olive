# Olive Command Lines

The Olive CLI provides a set of primitives such as `quantize`, `finetune`, `onnx-graph-capture`, `auto-opt` that enable you to *easily* optimize select models and experiment with different cutting-edge optimization strategies without the need to define workflows.

- [How to use the `olive optimize` command to optimize a Pytorch model](cli/cli-optimize)
- [How to use the `olive auto-opt` command to take a PyTorch/Hugging Face model and turn it into an optimized ONNX model](cli/cli-auto-opt)
- [how to use the `olive finetune` command to create (Q)LoRA adapters](cli/cli-finetune)
- [How to use the `olive quantize` command to quantize your model with different precisions and techniques such as AWQ](cli/cli-quantize)
- [How to use the `olive run` command to execute an Olive workflow.](cli/cli-run)
