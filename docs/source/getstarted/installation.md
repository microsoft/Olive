# Installation

We recommend installing Olive in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or a
[conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Olive is installed using
pip.

Create a virtual/conda environment with the desired version of Python and activate it.

You will need to install a build of [**onnxruntime**](https://onnxruntime.ai). You can install the desired build separately but
public versions of onnxruntime can also be installed as extra dependencies during Olive installation.

## Install with pip
Olive is available for installation from PyPI.
```
pip install olive-ai
```
With onnxruntime (Default CPU):
```
pip install olive-ai[cpu]
```
With onnxruntime-gpu:
```
pip install olive-ai[gpu]
```
With onnxruntime-directml:
```
pip install olive-ai[directml]
```

## Install from source
Install the latest `main` version of Olive from source. Please note that this is a development version and may not be stable.
