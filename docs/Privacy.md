#### Technical Details
Olive uses the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) API for its implementation. Based on user consent, this data may be periodically sent to Microsoft servers following GDPR and privacy regulations for anonymity and data access controls. Application, device, and version information is collected automatically.

In addition, Olive may collect optional telemetry data such as:
- User interactions
- Performance data
- Exception information

Collection of this additional telemetry can be disabled by adding the `--disable_telemetry` flag to your Olive CLI commands.
