# This file defines the capability of each pass. The capability is defined by
# the execution provider (EP), precision, and accelerator.
# 1. EP: the ort execution provider that the pass supports. The value can be any
#    of the available execution provider names in ort releases. The value is list
#    of strings. If the value is null, the pass supports all execution providers.
#    The value is case insensitive but suggest to use the same case as the
#    execution provider name(remove the suffix of "ExecutionProvider").
# 2. precision: the output model precision that the pass supports. The value is
#    list of strings. If the value is null, the pass supports all precisions.
#    Available precisions are: fp32, fp16, int8, int4.
# 3. accelerator: the accelerator that the pass supports. The value is list of
#    strings. If the value is null, the pass supports all accelerators.
#    Available accelerators are: cpu, gpu, npu.
# When anyone adds a new pass, please update this file to add the capability of
# the pass. The capability is used to filter the passes that are applicable to
# the model, target device, precision, and EPs.
