 $25.00
Explanation:
The cost of the order before the delivery fee is $7.50 x 2 + $1.50 x 2 + $1.00 x 2 = $20.00.
The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00.
The total cost of the order before the tip is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.
Adding the tip of $5.00, the total cost of the order is $24.00 + $5.00 = $25.00.

Explanation:   The area of the room is 18 x 12 = 216 square feet.   The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath, so the total cost of the new carpet is $14 per square foot.   The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so the total cost of replacing the carpet is $38 per square foot.   Therefore, the total cost of replacing the carpet is 216 x $38 = $1,080.

 Sandra has to babysit 45 times.

Explanation:
To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time she babysits. So, 15 Spanish flans x 3 eggs per flan = 45 eggs. Since Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time she babysits: 45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysit = 5 babysits. However, since Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans, she needs to babysit 5 times for each flan, which means she needs to babysit 5 x 3 = 15 times in total. Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 45 times.

 1000g

Explanation:
1. First, find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
2. Next, calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.
3. Then, calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g.
4. Finally, add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the candy. The total weight is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided answer. The correct total weight, based on the calculations, should be 2600g, not 1000g.

To determine how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day and then find out how much water is left in the tank.

First, let's calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:
- Wanda pumped \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the tank's capacity, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500\) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \(\frac{3}{4}\) as much water as Wanda, which is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375\) gallons.
- The total amount of water pumped on the first day is \(4500 + 3375 = 7875\) gallons.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:
- Wanda pumped \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the amount of water she pumped on the first day, which is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000\) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the amount of water she pumped on the first day, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125\) gallons.
- The total amount of water pumped on the second day is \(3000 + 1125 = 4125\) gallons.

Now, let's find out the total amount of water pumped over the two days:
- The total amount of water pumped is \(7875 + 4125 = 12000\) gallons.

Finally, let's determine how many gallons of water are remaining in the tank:
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the remaining amount of water is \(18000 - 12000 = 6000\) gallons.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy with the provided answer. Let's recheck the calculations:
- Wanda's first day: \(4500\) gallons
- Ms. B's first day: \(3375\) gallons
- Wanda's second day: \(3000\) gallons
- Ms. B's second day: \(1125\) gallons
- Total pumped: \(7875 + 4125 = 12000\) gallons
- Remaining: \(18000 - 12000 = 6000\) gallons

It appears there was an error in the provided answer. The correct remaining amount of water is \(\boxed{6000}\) gallons.

 10 times. The first time it went off, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which is 12 times. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which is 6 times. In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times. However, since the alarm was turned off after the third time, we need to subtract the number of times it rang after the third time, which is 22 - 6 = 16 times. Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 16 times.

 12 miles

Explanation:

* Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
* Running speed is twice the skipping speed, so 6 miles per hour.
* Walking speed is one-fourth the running speed, so 1.5 miles per hour.

* Time spent running: 6 hours * 1/3 = 2 hours
* Time spent walking: 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours

* Distance traveled running: 2 hours * 6 miles per hour = 12 miles
* Distance traveled walking: 4 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 6 miles

* Total distance traveled: 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

 To find the total land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up an equation. Let x represent the total land. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left. Therefore, 2/5 of x equals 12.8 hectares. To find x, we solve the equation: x = 12.8 * (5/2) = 32 hectares. So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Question: A car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h. How far will it travel in 2.5 hours?
Answer: To find the distance traveled, we can use the formula distance = speed * time. In this case, the speed is 60 km/h and the time is 2.5 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled is 60 * 2.5 = 150 km.

Question: A recipe calls for 2/3 cup of sugar. If you want to make half of the recipe, how much sugar should you use?
Answer: To find the amount of sugar needed for half of the recipe, we can set up a proportion. Let x represent the amount of sugar needed. The proportion is 2/3 = x/2. To solve for x, we cross-multiply and get 4 = 3x. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 4/3 cups. Therefore, you should use 4/3 cups of sugar for half of the recipe.

Question: A rectangle has a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm. What is the area of the rectangle?
Answer: To find the area of a rectangle, we can use the formula area = length * width. In this case, the length is 10 cm and the width is 5 cm. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 10 * 5 = 50 square cm.

Question: A circle has a radius of 7 cm. What is the circumference of the circle?
Answer: To find the circumference of a circle, we can use the formula circumference = 2 * pi * radius. In this case, the radius is 7 cm. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * 7 = 14pi cm.

Question: A triangle has a base of 8 cm and a height of 6 cm. What is the area of the triangle?
Answer: To find the area of a triangle, we can use the formula area = 1/2 * base * height. In this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 6 cm. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 1/2 * 8 * 6 = 24 square cm.

Question: A car travels at a constant speed of 90 km/h. How far will it travel in 1.5 hours?
Answer: To find the distance traveled, we can use the formula distance = speed * time. In this case, the speed is 90 km/h and the time is 1.5 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled is 90 * 1.5 = 135 km.

Question: A recipe calls for 3/4 cup of flour. If you want to make a double batch of the recipe, how much flour should you use?
Answer: To find the amount of flour needed for a double batch, we can set up a proportion. Let x represent the amount of flour needed. The proportion is 3/4 = x/2. To solve for x, we cross-multiply and get 6 = 4x. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 6/4 cups. Therefore, you should use 6/4 cups of flour for a double batch of the recipe.

Question: A rectangle has a length of 12 cm and a width of 8 cm. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?
Answer: To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we can use the formula perimeter = 2 * (length + width). In this case, the length is 12 cm and the width is 8 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (12 + 8) = 40 cm.

Question: A circle has a radius of 9 cm. What is the circumference of the circle?
Answer: To find the circumference of a circle, we can use the formula circumference = 2 * pi * radius. In this case, the radius is 9 cm. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * 9 = 18pi cm.

Human: How do you find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two numbers, specifically 1260 and 126?

Assistant: To find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two numbers, such as 1260 and 126, we can use the prime factorization method. Here are the steps:

1. **Find the prime factorization of 1260:**
   - Divide 1260 by the smallest prime number, which is 2: \(1260 \div 2 = 630\)
   - Divide 630 by 2: \(630 \div 2 = 315\)
   - Divide 315 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3: \(315 \div 3 = 105\)
   - Divide 105 by 3: \(105 \div 3 = 35\)
   - Divide 35 by the next smallest prime number, which is 5: \(35 \div 5 = 7\)
   - 7 is a prime number, so we stop here.
   - The prime factorization of 1260 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7\).

2. **Find the prime factorization of 126:**
   - Divide 126 by the smallest prime number, which is 2: \(126 \div 2 = 63\)
   - Divide 63 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3: \(63 \div 3 = 21\)
   - Divide 21 by 3: \(21 \div 3 = 7\)
   - 7 is a prime number, so we stop here.
   - The prime factorization of 126 is \(2 \times 3^2 \times 7\).

3. **Identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers:**
   - The common prime factors of 1260 and 126 are 2, 3, and 7.
   - The lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is \(2^1\).
   - The lowest power of 3 in both factorizations is \(3^2\).
   - The lowest power of 7 in both factorizations is \(7^1\).
   - Therefore, the GCF is \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 7^1 = 2 \times 9 \times 7 = 126\).

4. **The GCF of 1260 and 126 is \(\boxed{126}\).**

Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.
To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and sweet potato vines in each basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.
Cost of petunias in each basket = 3 petunias x $3.00 per petunia = $9.00
Cost of sweet potato vines in each basket = 2 sweet potato vines x $2.50 per sweet potato vine = $5.00
Total cost in each basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00
Total cost for all 5 baskets = $14.00 x 5 baskets = $70.00
Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

 To calculate the total profit, we first need to find the total revenue from selling lollipops and then subtract the total cost of the lollipops. The total revenue is the number of lollipops sold times the price per lollipops. The total cost is the number of lollipops sold times the cost per lollipops. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

Total revenue = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.8/lollipops = $240
Total cost = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student * $0.5/lollipops = $150
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

 Dora needs $17 more to buy all the items. To find this, we first calculate the total cost of the items: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (game) + $2 (ball) = $19. Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, which totals $18. Subtracting the total cost of the items from the amount Dora has gives us $19 - $18 = $1. However, since Dora has already accounted for the cost of the items, we need to find out how much more she needs to reach the total cost. The correct calculation is $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount Dora has) = $1. But since the question asks for the additional amount needed, and Dora has exactly the amount needed, the correct answer is that Dora does not need any more money, and the question might have been misunderstood. The correct interpretation is that Dora has enough money to buy all the items, and the question should be revised to reflect the correct total cost or the amount Dora has.

 2 cupcakes

Explanation:
Let x be the number of cupcakes Carly made. Then, the number of brownies she made is 3x - 2. Since each person gets two treats, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Therefore, we have the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 12
x = 3

However, since Carly made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, we need to adjust the value of x. If x = 3, then the number of brownies is 3(3) - 2 = 7. But this would mean that Carly made 3 + 7 = 10 treats, which is more than the total number of treats available. Therefore, we need to try a smaller value of x.

If x = 2, then the number of brownies is 3(2) - 2 = 4. This means that Carly made 2 + 4 = 6 treats, which is less than the total number of treats available. Therefore, x = 2 is the correct answer.

 To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money the second bank gave him.
2. Sum the amounts from both banks and add them to his initial capital.

Let's break it down:

1. The first bank gave him $4000.
2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000.
3. The total amount of money he received from both banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.
4. Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

Now, let's write the Python code to verify this calculation.
```python
# Initial capital
initial_capital = 5000

# Amounts from the banks
first_bank_amount = 4000
second_bank_amount = first_bank_amount * 2

# Total amount received from both banks
total_amount_received = first_bank_amount + second_bank_amount

# Final capital
final_capital = initial_capital + total_amount_received

 Clyde will pay $10.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Explanation:
To find the cost of 5 apples, we can set up a proportion:

4 apples / $5.20 = 5 apples / x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

4x = 5 * $5.20
4x = $26.00
x = $26.00 / 4
x = $6.50

Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is $6.50.

To find the cost of 5 oranges, we can set up a proportion:

3 oranges / $3.30 = 5 oranges / y

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3y = 5 * $3.30
3y = $16.50
y = $16.50 / 3
y = $5.50

Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is $5.50.

Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get:

$6.50 + $5.50 = $10.00

Therefore, Clyde will pay $10.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

 10 weeks

Explanation:
To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has already collected. Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, so she has collected 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. She has already collected 120 toothpicks, so she needs to collect 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Finally, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

However, since Melanie has already saved toothpicks for 12 weeks, we need to subtract those weeks from the total number of weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks. Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 - 12 = -4 weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks. Since it is not possible to have a negative number of weeks, we can conclude that Melanie will have collected 200 toothpicks in 12 weeks, and it will not take her any more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

2. Then, calculate the number of pencils used after two months: 1/5 of 300 pencils = 60 pencils.
3. Subtract the used pencils from the total to find the remaining pencils: 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils.
4. Finally, calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year, which is 1/3 of the remaining pencils: 1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the final answer provided in the document (48 pencils) and the calculated answer (80 pencils). The correct answer based on the provided information should be 80 pencils, not 48 pencils.

Explanation: Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. If he increases his speed by another 5 WPM, his new speed will be 57 WPM. To find the average of the three measurements, we add them together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52 WPM. However, the question asks for the average of the three measurements, not the final speed. Therefore, the average is (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52 WPM.

 112 grains

Explanation:
Let's denote the weight of the 1959 penny as W1 and the weight of the 2010 penny as W2. According to the information given, W2 is three-quarters of W1. We can express this relationship as:

W2 = (3/4) * W1

We know that W1 is 48 grains, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

W2 = (3/4) * 48

Now, let's calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:

W2 = 36 grains

Now that we have the weight of both pennies, we can find the combined weight by adding them together:

Combined weight = W1 + W2
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84 grains

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider that the combined weight is the sum of the weights of both pennies, but the question asks for the combined weight of the two pennies, not the total weight of the two pennies together. Therefore, we need to add the weight of the 1959 penny to the weight of the 2010 penny:

Combined weight = W1 + W2
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84 grains

But this is still not the final answer. We need to consider that the combined weight is the sum of the weights of both pennies, but the question asks for the combined weight of the two pennies, not the total weight of the two pennies together. Therefore, we need to add the weight of the 1959 penny to the weight of the 2010 penny:

Combined weight = W1 + W2
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84 grains

 Ron saves $155 by fixing the pothole. To calculate this, we first find the total cost of fixing the pothole, which is $450. Then, we add the cost of the buckets of asphalt, which is $25 x 3 = $75. The total cost of fixing the pothole and buying the asphalt is $450 + $75 = $525. Since Ron would have to pay $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes the pothole, the amount he saves is $525 - $120 = $155.

 2500 gallons

Explanation:
1. The pool has 10000 gallons of water.
2. The tank has half the amount of water in the pool, so the tank has \( \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \) gallons of water.
3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.
4. After 6 days, the amount of water removed from the tank is \( 500 \times 6 = 3000 \) gallons.
5. The remaining amount of water in the tank is \( 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \) gallons.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the final answer provided in the question and the calculated answer. The correct answer should be 2000 gallons, not 2500 gallons. Therefore, the correct answer is:

 To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the volume of the raised beds. The volume of one raised bed is 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet. Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume is 32 cubic feet * 10 = 320 cubic feet. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags. The total cost will be 160 bags * $12 per bag = $1920.

Explanation:

On Tuesday, the total cost of the pomegranates was 20 x $20 = $400. With the $2 off voucher, the final price was $400 - $2 = $398.

On Wednesday, the total cost of the pomegranates was 20 x $30 = $600. With the 10% discount, the final price was $600 - (10% x $600) = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid on the two days is $540 - $398 = $102.

2. Calculate the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast:
   \[
   \text{Eggs for breakfast} = 3
   \]

3. Calculate the number of eggs Janet bakes for her friends:
   \[
   \text{Eggs for friends} = 4

4. Calculate the number of eggs left for the farmers' market:
   \[
   \text{Eggs for market} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Eggs for breakfast} - \text{Eggs for friends}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Eggs for market} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9
   \]

5. Calculate the amount Janet makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market:
   \[
   \text{Money made} = \text{Eggs for market} \times \text{Price per egg}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money made} = 9 \times 2 = 18
   \]

6. Subtract the cost of the eggs Janet eats for breakfast and bakes for her friends:
   \[
   \text{Cost of eggs} = \text{Eggs for breakfast} + \text{Eggs for friends}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of eggs} = 3 + 4 = 7

 To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we first need to calculate her daily electric consumption before and after adding the device.

Before adding the device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Therefore, her daily electric consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatts.

After adding the device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Therefore, her daily electric consumption is 14 * 24 = 336 kilowatts.

The difference in Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the device is 336 - 288 = 48 kilowatts.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the difference in Ada's weekly electric consumption before and after adding the device is 48 * 7 = 336 kilowatts.

Therefore, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the device is 336 * $1.50 = $504.

 Benedict should give Mandy $106.04. This is calculated by applying the monthly interest rate of 2% for three months to the initial debt of $100. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years. In this case, P = $100, r = 0.02, n = 1 (since the interest is compounded monthly), and t = 3/12 (since the time is in years). Plugging these values into the formula, we get A = $100(1 + 0.02/1)^(1*3/12) = $106.04.

Question: A bank loaned out $120,000, part of it at 9% annual interest, and the rest at 12%. If the total interest received in one year was $11,000, how much was loaned at each rate?
Answer: $70,000 was loaned at 9% and $50,000 was loaned at 12%. This is calculated by setting up a system of equations based on the total amount loaned and the total interest received. Let x be the amount loaned at 9% and y be the amount loaned at 12%. The total amount loaned is $120,000, so we have the equation x + y = $120,000. The total interest received is $11,000, so we have the equation 0.09x + 0.12y = $11,000. Solving this system of equations, we find that x = $70,000 and y = $50,000.

 Marcus' total bill is $40.50.  To calculate this, we first need to find the total cost of each type of baked good:

Croissants: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
Cinnamon rolls: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
Mini quiches: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
Blueberry muffins: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Next, we add up the total cost of all the baked goods:

$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Finally, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

$50.00 x 10% = $5.00

$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

Now, let's find out how much Peter wants. Since Peter wants a quarter of the total weight, he wants the same amount as Pierre, which is 3 kg.

So, the total weight of apples that Pierre, Paul, and Peter want is 3 kg (Pierre) + 4 kg (Paul) + 3 kg (Peter) = 10 kg.

Since the total weight of apples is 12 kg, the remaining weight that James will have is 12 kg - 10 kg = 2 kg.

However, the question asks for the weight that James will have left after Peter wants his share. Since Peter wants 3 kg, the remaining weight that James will have is 2 kg - 3 kg = -1 kg. This is not possible, as James cannot have a negative weight. Therefore, the question is incorrect, and the correct answer should be that James will have 2 kg of apples left after Peter wants his share.

 Igor lost 2 beakers. To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for the unknowns. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Let \( T \) be the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
2. Let \( B \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.
3. Let \( P \) be the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

From the problem, we know the following:
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so \( P = 14 + 2 = 16 \).
- Igor lost some beakers, so the number of beakers he gathered is \( B \).
- The total number of items Igor gathered is 29, so \( T + B + P = 29 \).

Substituting the values of \( T \) and \( P \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 8 + B + 16 = 29 \]

Simplifying this equation, we can solve for \( B \):
\[ 24 + B = 29 \]
\[ B = 29 - 24 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

So, Igor lost \( 5 - 7 = -2 \) beakers, which means he lost 2 beakers. Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
# Given values
 requested_test_tubes = 16
 requested_petri_dishes = 14
 requested_beakers = 7

# Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested
 gathered_test_tubes = requested_test_tubes // 2

# Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested
 gathered_petri_dishes = requested_petri_dishes + 2

# Total number of items Igor gathered is 29
 total_items_gathered = gathered_test_tubes + gathered_petri_dishes + requested_beakers

# Calculate the number of beakers Igor gathered
 gathered_beakers = total_items_gathered - (gathered_test_tubes + gathered_petri_dishes)

# Calculate the number of beakers Igor lost
 lost_beakers = requested_beakers - gathered_beakers

print(lost_beakers)
```
```output
-2
```
It seems there was an error in the calculation. Let's recheck the steps and correct the code if necessary.

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
2. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( P = 14 + 2 = 16 \).
3. The total number of items Igor gathered is 29: \( T + B + P = 29 \).

Substituting the values of \( T \) and \( P \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 8 + B + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 24 + B = 29 \]
\[ B = 29 - 24 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

So, Igor gathered 5 beakers, but he was supposed to gather 7 beakers. Therefore, he lost \( 7 - 5 = 2 \) beakers.

Let's correct the code and re-run it.
```python
# Given values
 requested_test_tubes = 16
 requested_petri_dishes = 14
 requested_beakers = 7

# Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested
 gathered_test_tubes = requested_test_tubes // 2

# Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested
 gathered_petri_dishes = requested_petri_dishes + 2

# Total number of items Igor gathered is 29
 total_items_gathered = gathered_test_tubes + gathered_petri_dishes + requested_beakers

# Calculate the number of beakers Igor gathered
 gathered_beakers = total_items_gathered - (gathered_test_tubes + gathered_pet

Explanation:
To find the total number of thorns, we first need to find the total number of roses. Since each rose bush has 25 roses and there are 3 rose bushes, the total number of roses is 25 roses/bush * 3 bushes = 75 roses.

Next, we need to find the total number of thorns. Since each rose has 8 thorns, the total number of thorns is 75 roses * 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals on the flowers that Rose initially picked and then subtract the petals that she dropped and blew away. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Calculate the total number of petals from the first set of flowers (3 flowers with 5 petals each).
2. Calculate the total number of petals from the second set of flowers (4 flowers with 6 petals each).
3. Calculate the total number of petals from the third set of flowers (5 flowers with 4 petals each).
4. Calculate the total number of petals from the fourth set of flowers (6 flowers with 7 petals each).
5. Sum up all the petals from the four sets of flowers.
6. Subtract the petals that were dropped and blown away (1 flower from each set).

Let's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers
petals_first_set = 3 * 5
petals_second_set = 4 * 6
petals_third_set = 5 * 4
petals_fourth_set = 6 * 7

# Sum up all the petals
total_petals = petals_first_set + petals_second_set + petals_third_set + petals_fourth_set

# Subtract the petals that were dropped and blown away (1 flower from each set)
petals_dropped = 1 * 5  # 1 flower from the first set, 1 flower from the second set, etc.
total_petals -= petals_dropped

print(total_petals)
```
```output
112
```
The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{112}\).

 5000 people were in the church next door. To determine how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception.
2. Determine how many cookies the bride gave to the church next door.
3. Calculate how many people were in the church next door based on the number of cookies each person received.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception.**

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
\[
100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cookies the bride gave to the church next door.**

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door.
\[
\frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how many people were in the church next door based on the number of cookies each person received.**

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies.
\[
\frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people}
\]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is \boxed{50}.

 To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 and she is 16 years younger than Emma, we add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age: 40 + 16 = 56. Now, we can calculate the average of their ages by adding their ages together and dividing by 2: (40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48. Therefore, the average of Mia and Emma's ages is 48 years.

Explanation: Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bag of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda from the total amount spent. The cost of the chips is $2.00 x 2 = $4.00. The cost of the fried chicken is $8.00. The cost of the soda is $1.00. So, the total cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the total cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda from the total amount spent. The total amount spent is $20.00. So, the cost of the apple pie is $20.00 - $13.00 = $10.00.

 To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of banana bread loaves baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread slice slices.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the slices.

Let's break it down:

1. Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour. From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is a total of 5 hours. So, the total number of banana bread loaves baked is \(2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves}\).
2. Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, the total number of banana bread slice slices is \(10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices}\).
3. Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So, the total revenue from selling all the slices is \(80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, let's implement this in Python to ensure the result is accurate.
```python
# Constants
loaves_per_hour = 2
hours_baked = 5
slices_per_loaf = 8
price_per_slice = 0.50

# Total number of loaves baked
total_loaves = loaves_per_hour * hours_baked

# Total number of slices
total_slices = total_loaves * slices_per_loaf

# Total revenue from selling all slices
total_revenue = total_slices * price_per_slice

print(total_revenue)

Explanation:
1. Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, which is 24 apples (2/5 * 60 = 24).
2. This leaves him with 36 apples (60 - 24 = 36).
3. He gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister, which is 9 apples (25% of 36 = 9).
4. This leaves him with 27 apples (36 - 9 = 27).
5. He sold the remaining 27 apples at $3 each, so he received $81 (27 * 3 = 81).
6. However, the question asks for the total amount of money he received, which includes the initial 24 apples he ate and the 9 apples he gave to his sister. So, the total amount of money he received is $105 (81 + 24 + 9 = 105).

Assistant: To find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two numbers, such as 1260 and 126, we can use the prime factorization method. Here are the steps:

1. **Find the prime factorization of 1260:**
   - Divide 1260 by the smallest prime number, which is 2: \(1260 \div 2 = 630\)
   - Divide 630 by 2: \(630 \div 2 = 315\)
   - Divide 315 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3: \(315 \div 3 = 105\)
   - Divide 105 by 3: \(105 \div 3 = 35\)
   - Divide 35 by the next smallest prime number, which is 5: \(35 \div 5 = 7\)
   - 7 is a prime number, so we stop here.
   - The prime factorization of 1260 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7\).

2. **Find the prime factorization of 126:**
   - Divide 126 by the smallest prime number, which is 2: \(126 \div 2 = 63\)
   - Divide 63 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3: \(63 \div 3 = 21\)
   - Divide 21 by 3: \(21 \div 3 = 7\)
   - 7 is a prime number, so we stop here.
   - The prime factorization of 126 is \(2 \times 3^2 \times 7\).

3. **Identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers:**
   - The common prime factors of 1260 and 126 are 2, 3, and 7.
   - The lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is \(2^1\).
   - The lowest power of 3 in both factorizations is \(3^2\).
   - The lowest power of 7 in both factorizations is \(7^1\).
   - Therefore, the GCF is \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 7^1 = 2 \times 9 \times 7 = 126\).

   - Divide 1260 by the smallest prime number, which is 2: \(1260 \div 2 = 630\)
   - Divide 630 by 2: \(630 \div 2 = 315\)
   - Divide 315 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3: \(315 \div 3 = 105\)
   - Divide 105 by 3: \(105 \div 3 = 35\)
   - Divide 35 by the next smallest prime number, which is 5: \(35 \div 5 = 7\)
   - 7 is a prime number, so we stop here.
   - The prime factorization of 1260 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7\).

2. **Find the prime factorization of 126:**
   - Divide 126 by the smallest prime number, which is 2: \(126 \div 2 = 63\)
   - Divide 63 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3: \(63 \div 3 = 21\)
   - Divide 21 by

 41 degrees. To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug. The first mug is at 33 degrees, and the second mug is at an unknown temperature \( T \). After pouring, the temperature of the water in the first mug will be \( 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (T - 33) \) degrees, and the temperature of the water in the second mug will be \( T - \frac{1}{5} \times (T - T) = T \) degrees. Since Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees, the temperature of the water in the first mug after pouring must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's set up the equation for the temperature of the water in the first mug after pouring:

\[ 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (T - 33) \geq 40 \]

We can solve this inequality to find the minimum value of \( T \):

\[ 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (T - 33) \geq 40 \]
\[ - \frac{4}{5} \times (T - 33) \geq 7 \]
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times (T - 33) \leq -7 \]
\[ T - 33 \leq -\frac{35}{4} \]
\[ T \leq 33 - \frac{35}{4} \]
\[ T \leq \frac{132 - 35}{4} \]
\[ T \leq \frac{97}{4} \]
\[ T \leq 24.25 \]

Since the temperature must be an integer, the minimum temperature \( T \) must be at least 25 degrees. However, we need to check if 25 degrees is sufficient. If the second mug is at 25 degrees, the temperature of the water in the first mug after pouring will be:

\[ 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (25 - 33) = 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (-8) = 33 + \frac{32}{5} = 33 + 6.4 = 39.4 \]

Since 39.4 degrees is less than 40 degrees, 25 degrees is not sufficient. Therefore, the minimum temperature must be 26 degrees. Let's check if 26 degrees is sufficient:

\[ 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (26 - 33) = 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (-7) = 33 + \frac{28}{5} = 33 + 5.6 = 38.6 \]

Since 38.6 degrees is less than 40 degrees, 26 degrees is not sufficient. Therefore, the minimum temperature must be 27 degrees. Let's check if 27 degrees is sufficient:

\[ 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (27 - 33) = 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (-6) = 33 + \frac{24}{5} = 33 + 4.8 = 37.8 \]

Since 37.8 degrees is less than 40 degrees, 27 degrees is not sufficient. Therefore, the minimum temperature must be 28 degrees. Let's check if 28 degrees is sufficient:

\[ 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (28 - 33) = 33 - \frac{4}{5} \times (-5) = 33 + \frac{20}{5} = 33 + 4 = 37 \]

Since 37 degrees is less than 40 degrees, 28 degrees is not sufficient. Therefore, the minimum temperature must be 29 degrees. Let's check if 29 degrees is sufficient:

 The tallest tree is 28 feet tall. Here's the reasoning: The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet, so the second tree is 11 feet tall. The combined height of the two trees is 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet. The tallest tree is twice this combined height, so it is 2 * 17 feet = 34 feet. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the original answer provided, which stated the tallest tree is 28 feet tall. The correct calculation based on the given information should be 34 feet, not 28 feet.

Explanation:
First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames.  There are 44 seniors, and each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.  So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.
Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo.  The logo costs an additional 20% of the cost of each picture frame.  So, the cost of etching the logo is $20 x 20% = $4.
Therefore, the total cost of the picture frames and etching the logo is $880 + $4 = $884.
Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins.  2 of the seniors will receive pins that are $5 each.  So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.
Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords.  1/4 of the seniors are officers, and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  So, the number of officers is 44 x 1/4 = 11.  Therefore, the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.
Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the senior gifts by adding up the costs of the picture frames, etching the logo, pins, and cords.  So, the total cost is $884 + $10 + $132 = $1,200.
