# Prerequisites

## Windows
```bash

```

## Linux
```bash
sh build.sh
```

# Start the Web App
### Windows
On Windows you can run to start both frontend and backend servers
```
start-windows.sh
```

### Linux
Open front-end server.
```
npm run --prefix frontend serve
```

In a separate command prompt, open back-end server.
```
sudo python backend/app.py
```

Then the local server has been built on http://localhost:8000/
