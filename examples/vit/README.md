## Workflows

### ViT with QDQ
This example performs ViT quantization in one workflow. It performs the pipeline:
- *Huggingface Model -> Onnx Model -> Quantized Onnx Model with QDQ format*

Config file: [vit_qdq.json](vit_qdq.json)

#### Accuracy / latency

| Model Version         | Accuracy            |  Latency (ms/sample) | Dataset  |
|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|
| PyTorch FP32          | 77.3%               | 1892.2               | Imagenet |
| ONNX INT8 (QDQ)       | 77.3%               | 287.5                | Imagenet |

*Note: Latency can vary significantly depending on the CPU hardware and system environment. The values provided here are for reference only and may not reflect performance on all devices.*

## How to run
```
olive run --config <config_file>.json
```

After running the above command, the final model will be saved in the *output_dir* specified in the config file.
